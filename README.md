# Xentrix task

This project is inspired by a junior developer task provided by Xentrix, along with a Figma UI design that outlines the core layout and user interactions. The goal of the assignment is to translate the provided interface into a functional MERN-stack application while respecting the visual guidelines and component structure defined in the Figma prototype.

## Technologies and Tools

### Frontend

- Vite.js: A modern front-end build tool that provides a fast development experience.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build responsive and customizable interfaces directly in the markup, enabling rapid UI development with consistent styling.

### Backend

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- MongoDB: A document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.
